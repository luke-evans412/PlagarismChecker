# PlagarismChecker
This is a plagarism checker for CSC-3400-01: Artificial Intelligence at Belmont University. We will be creating a plagarism checker 
with capabilities for both written regular text, and code in at least one language.

Some sources I found for plagarism checking datasets/tutorials
